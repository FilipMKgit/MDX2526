# NI-SIZER

NI-Sizer is an Interactive sample size exploration app for non-inferiority trials.

Purpose
-Explore how NI margins, expected performance, alpha, power, and allocation ratio affect required sample size.

How to use
-Proportions tab: binary outcomes (risk difference NI).
-Continuous tab: mean difference NI.
-Use sensitivity plots to see how assumptions impact sample size.

Notes
-Plots are for planning/sensitivity analysis, not a full SAP.
-Always validate final design choices with a statistician.
