# NI-Sizer

NI-Sizer is an Interactive sample size exploration app for non-inferiority trials.<br>

Purpose<br>
-Explore how NI margins, expected performance, alpha, power, and allocation ratio affect required sample size.

How to use<br>
-Proportions tab: binary outcomes (risk difference NI).<br>
-Continuous tab: mean difference NI.<br>
-Use sensitivity plots to see how assumptions impact sample size.<br>

Notes<br>
-Plots are for planning/sensitivity analysis, not a full SAP.<br>
-Always validate final design choices with a statistician.
