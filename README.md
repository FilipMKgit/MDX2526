# NI-Sizer

NI-Sizer is an Interactive sample size exploration app for non-inferiority trials.<br>

Purpose<br>
-Explore how NI margins, expected performance, alpha, power, and allocation ratio affect required sample size.

How to use<br>
-Proportions tab: binary outcomes (risk difference NI).<br>
-Continuous tab: mean difference NI.<br>
-Use sensitivity plots to see how assumptions impact sample size.<br>

Notes<br>
-Plots are for planning/sensitivity analysis, not a full SAP.<br>
-Always validate final design choices with a statistician.

To Do:<br>
-Add equations to set up tab.<br>
-Limit sliders to minimize number of errors.<br>
-Fix slider labels in tab 2.<br>
-Rework text in tab 1.<br>
-Add credits and github link on bottom of tab 1.<br>
-Make labels bigger on graphs.<br>
-Make the graphs easy to download.<br>
-Fix bug where switching back to light mode from dark mode keeps some labels white/invisible.<br>
-See if I can change tab 3 into sliders to keep the app exploratory and consistent.
